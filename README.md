## Your Cohort Lead:
Dominique De Leon - dominique.deleon@flatironschool.com - [Schedule 1:1 time with Dominique](https://go.oncehub.com/ProjectSupport1to1)

## Your Educational Coach:
Katie McKenna - katie.mckenna@flatironschool.com - [Booking Link](https://katiemckenna.youcanbook.me/service/jsps/cal.jsp?cal=9772962d-a4c0-4141-be45-b829efe3a91a&ini=1584729963217&service=jsid9132396)

## Helpful links:
- [Schedule your javascript assessment!](https://go.oncehub.com/StructuredProgramJavascriptProjectReviews)

## Announcements:
- Mod 5 starts on 11/16! Due to the Thanksgiving Holiday (Flatiron is closed 11/26 and 11/27) the Mod 4 review DEADLINE has been moved to EOB on Monday, 11/30. Try to schedule your first attempt as early as possible, to allow for a second (or third) attempt if needed. For mods 4 and 5, it is probably a safe bet to assume that you will need to do at least two attempts - the bar is higher for these projects.

## Any questions or issues please DM me.
